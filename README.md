# Introduction to Python and Setting Up Python for AI Development
## Description
### Introduction to Python:
Python is a popular programming language. It is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code.
### Python for AI Development:
Python provides a clear and readable syntax hence provides a smooth path to learn and build intelligent models without complex code structures. The best part of using Python is its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks specially tailored for AI and machine learning. Python has strong community of AI enthusiasts, researchers and developers who share knowledge, insights and resources. The collaborative spirit of the Python AI community ensures that help is always within reach.
The journey of Artificial Intelligence requires strong foundation in python programming and to ensure strong solid starting point.
### Setting Up Python for AI Development
This guide provides step-by-step instruction to set up Python for AI development and assist beginners to install python easily. 
## Installing Python (windows)
